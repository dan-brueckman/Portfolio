# Web Scraping
##### This project demonstrates a knowledge of Python, BeautifulSoup, HTML. 
#
#### In this project, I created a Python script that would search both Yelp and OpenTable for mentions of a certain waiter/waitress' name. If found, it then sends the review to the email provided. 
#### I used BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML of the target URL and then scrape the page based on the HTML tags specified. The code can be found in this folder.
