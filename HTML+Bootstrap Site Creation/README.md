# HTML + Bootstrap Site Creation 
##### This project displays a knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap. 
#
#### In this project, I created an HTML site with a dropdown menu leading to other pages of data/graphs. I used Bootstrap to design the page. 
#### The code that pulled the data and created the graphs for this site was also written by me and is located in the "Python Weather API Requests" folder within my portfolio (https://github.com/dan-brueckman/Portfolio/tree/master/Python%20Weather%20API%20Requests).
