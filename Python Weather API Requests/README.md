# Python Weather API Requests
##### This project demonstrates a knowledge of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and API requests. 
#
#### In this project, I looked at how the weather changes as we approach the equator. I generated a random list of coordinates and used the OpenWeatherMap API to pull weather data for the cities located at those coordinates. 
#### I used this data to create four graphs:
  * Temperature (F) vs. Latitude
  * Humidity (%) vs. Latitude
  * Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude
  * Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude
#
#### Brief Trends in the Data

##### The temperature on this day was much higher on average at and below the equator than above it. At about 20 degrees latitude, we see a drop in temperature. 

##### Humidity and cloudiness did not seem to be affected by latitudinal position. Though, at higher lines of latitude there do seem to be more locations registering higher humidity on the day analyzed.

##### Wind speed also did not seem to be affected by latitudinal position.
