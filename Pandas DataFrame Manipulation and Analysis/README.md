# Pandas DataFrame Manipulation and Analysis
##### This project displays a knowledge of Python and Pandas. 
#
#### In this project, I acted as an analyst for a gaming company. I needed to provide an analysis of the data from a game called "Heroes of Pymoli." The company wanted a report breaking down the game's purchasing data into meaningful insights. 
#### This report included: Player count, purchasing analysis, gender demographics, purchasing analysis (gender), age demographics, top spenders, most popular items, and most profitable items. 
#### The code I wrote can be found in an ipython file within this folder that contains images of the DataFrame views created.

#### Brief Trends in the Data:
#### Men account for the lions share of purchases (81%), as well as total revenue. 
#### The majority of those making purchases are between the ages of 20-24 (39%), followed by 15-19 (24%)
#### The top 5 purchasers had average purchases prices well above the average
#### “Final Critic” was the most popular as well as the highest revenue producer
