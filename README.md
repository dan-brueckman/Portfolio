# Dan Brueckman's Portfolio
Hello, and welcome to my portfolio! A little about me... I am an aspiring Data Analyst with many newly acquired skills that are presented here. I have been enrolled in the University of Texas Data Science and Visualization Boot Camp since January and am excited to be pursuing the next step in my career. I started my career in software sales, having success and moving into roles selling more and more complex software. I eventually decided that I did not want to pursue sales further, but wanted to involve myself in something that I was passionate about. My sales background helped me accumulate experience in business strategy, internal and external communication, and process management.
#### Enter data analytics! 
I have always had a passion for data and a curiosity that is hard to satisfy. I am looking for a position that will allow me to: utilize my new skills, continue to develop and learn, draw on my creativity, be involved in multiple projects, and drive real change in an organization and those affected by it.

#### A little personal information... <br>
I am originally from the Annapolis, Maryland area. I moved to Austin two years ago in search of new experiences and it has not failed me! In my free time I love to be active, read, and attend music/art shows here in Austin. I often camp, hike, kayak, run, bike, and rock climb. I also enjoy participating in social sport leagues with friends, including basketball, kickball, volleyball and flag football. <br>
 <br>
I read fairly religiously, and while science fiction is my favorite genre, I enjoy reading almost anything. Currently, I am reading The Lean Startup, by Eric Ries.
