##### This project displays a knowledge of Javascript, D3.js, and HTML.

#### In this project, I was tasked with using D3.js to create a scatter plot displaying the correlation between two data variables, each measured state by state and taken from different data sources. I also embedded this scatter plot into an iframe and created an HTML page to render the plot. 
#### I pulled U.S. Census Bureau and 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor data for this project and looked at the correlation between those with a Bachelor's Degree or higher, and exercise frequency. I found that those with a Bachelor's or higher were much more likely to report exercising at least once per month.
