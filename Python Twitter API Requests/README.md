# Python Twitter API Requests
##### This project demonstrates a knowledge of Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and the Twitter API. 
#
#### In this project, I created a Python script to perform a sentiment analysis of the Twitter activity of various news oulets (BBC, CBS, CNN, Fox, and New York times), and presented my findings visually. I used VADER to perform the sentiment analysis. 
#### Two graphs were created; a Scatter plot of the compound scores of each of the last 100 tweets per outlet, and a bar graph of the aggregate score of all of these tweets per outlet. 
#### The code and graphs can be found in the ipython notebook within this folder.

#### Brief Trends in the Data

##### At the time of this analysis, the NY Times was the only twitter account with a mean compound sentiment score above zero. 

##### Over the course of a three days analysis, the NY Times was consistently slightly above zero, while no one else has rose above zero during that time. 

##### BBC World was consistently the most negative over the three days of analysis.
