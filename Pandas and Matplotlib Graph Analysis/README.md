# Pandas and Matplotlib Graph Analysis
##### This project displays a knowledge of Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
#
#### In this project, I acted as an analyst for a pharmaceutical company called Pymaceuticals that specializes in drug-based, anti-cancer pharmaceuticals. In their most recent efforts, they've begun screening for potential treatments to squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. 
#### I was given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 250 mice were treated through a variety of drug regimes over the course of 45 days. Their physiological responses were then monitored over the course of that time. My objective was to analyze the data to show how four treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, and Placebo) compare.
#### I was tasked with: 
  * Creating a scatter plot that shows how the tumor volume changes over time for each treatment.
  * Creating a scatter plot that shows how the number of metastatic (cancer spreading) sites changes over time for each treatment.
  * Creating a scatter plot that shows the number of mice still alive through the course of treatment (Survival Rate)
  * Creating a bar graph that compares the total % tumor volume change for each drug across the full 45 days.
#### This code can be found in an ipython file within this folder that also contains images of the plots.

#### Brief Trends in the Data

##### Of the 4 drugs analyzed here, Capomulin had the highest survival rate, losing less than 20% of mice studied. The next best drug (Ketapril), lost 40% of mice.

##### Of the 4 drugs analyzed here, Capomulin had the fewest instances of metastatic spread during treatment. Capomulin had an average of 1.5 new sites by the 45th day. The next closest (Infubinol) had just over 2 sites on average.

##### Of the 4 drugs analyzed here, Capomulin was the only drug to show an actual decrease in tumor volume during the study. Tumor volume decreased on average by nearly 20%, while it's closest competitor in the study showed tumor volume increases of 46% on average.
