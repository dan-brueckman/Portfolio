# Python SQLAlchemy Work
##### This project demonstrates a knowledge of Python, SQL, SQLAlchemy, and Flask.
#
#### In this project, I was to be preparing for a vacation to Hawaii. I did climate analysis and created a few graphs as well as a Flask API that would allow others to access my analysis. 
#### There are two ipython notebooks in this folder; One that was used to clean the data and another that was used to create the graphs and Flask application. I created a SQLlite database and used this to make queries in SQLAlchemy. 
#### Data Queried:
  * Last 12 months of precipitation data
  * Last 12 months of temperature observation data
